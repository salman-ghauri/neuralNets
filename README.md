## Neural Nets and CNN implementation
### This repo has been inspired and contains from Micheal Neilson's **Neural Networks and Deep learning** book's last chapter.

Note that I have also used Theano but version 1.0.0 (book uses 0.6). This is just for the sake of practice and steps followed in the book. I get accuracy of 99.5% running on local GPU. You can try out various architechtures. For more details, visit: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
 - Edit the file nn.py and add your own architecture
 - I have not yet added the code for augmented data. I am planning to use tensorflow or PyTorch to implement all this work.


---------------
**Update**

I have added CNN from theano to tensorflow. I have used the name Neilson Net (I read this name somewhere) for it. I am getting 99.6% accuracy on the test dataset.
